                  <h3>Why Teaching Kids?</h3>
                  <img alt="children doing isha yoga" src="assets/images/yoga-blog.png">
                  <p class="lead-strong"> For those of you have been in touch with us for some time, you must have noticed that we plan a lot of programs for kids 😄 So why this focus on kids and coming up with more offerings for them?
                     This is primarily because one of the biggest learning experiences and turning point in my life happened due to teaching kids!
                     Ever since then, my eyes light up whenever I get an opportunity to spend time with kids — I consider these young ones as my mentors, who showed me how I should be.
